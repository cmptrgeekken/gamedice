Usage
-----
**The Screen**

The screen is divided into three sections:
* The top most section is the menu bar containing the current time (so you know when to order your pizza) and battery status (if low). 
* The second section, with the white background, contains the result of the dice roll. 
* The lower back section contains both the dice being rolled in standard dice notation (1d20, 8d100, 2d4, etc.) and the button mode -- _#d_ for changing the number of dice to roll, and _d#_ for changing the sides on the dice being rolled.


**Buttons**
* Select Button (long press) - Roll the die!
* Select Button (normal press) - Switch between updating the dice's sides (d#), and the quantity of dice to roll (#d)
* Up Button - Increase the dice's sides (d#) or dice quantity (#d). Hold this button for speedy changes.
* Down Button - Decrease the dice's sides (d#) or dice quantity (#d). Hold this button for speedy changes.
