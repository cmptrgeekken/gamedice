**The Screen**
The screen is divided into four sections. The top most section is the menu bar containing the current time (so you know when to order your pizza) and battery status (if low). 
The second section, with the white background, contains the result of the dice roll. 
The lower back section contains both the dice being rolled in standard dice notation (1d20, 8d100, 2d4, etc.) and the button mode -- #d for changing the number of dice to roll, and d# for changing the sides on the dice being rolled.
